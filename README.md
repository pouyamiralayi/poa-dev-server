# poa-dev-server
simple dev server with easy integration based on webpack

full control over webpack by leveraging webpack middlewares and plugins.
easily integrate any frontend framework you desire, default mode has react integration. but that could be easily replaced with other
frameworks in your src/app.js file and in case you do not want any framework, just comment require('app.js') in src/main.js
